Description
===========
   
   The app uses the native device's touchscreen interface to interact with the user.
   D Pad equips a pretty simple home screen with usable buttons providing easy user interaction. 
   
   The "Start" button takes the user to the main user interface where he/she interacts with a standard 
   5-piece drum kit (with 4 cymbals) using a mouse click (on desktops/laptops) or a finger tap 
   (in case of mobile devices).
   
   It is an ideal drumming app for mobile devices.
   D Pad works quite fluently with finger taps on mobile devices. On a desktop its rather difficult to 
   use a mouse for such an app. So desktops/laptops can be used to just test the app out.
   
   The user interface points out clickable / tapable parts of the drums / cymbals using a large 'circle'.
   When the user clicks or taps on the circle or somwhere around it, the corresponding sound of the drum kit is played. 
   E.g. If the user clicks on the circle imprinted on the snare drum then the snare sound would be played.

   A second button, "Credits" shows the details and refernces about the media used in the project. Tools used 
   for audio, graphics etc.
   
   The Credits page has the "Start" button as "always active" for interaction (never hidden) so as the user 
   can quickly switch back to the user interface from the Credits page. Similarly, the user interface has 
   the "Credits" button as "always active" for quick interaction (never hidden) so as the user can view the 
   credits anytime.
   
   
   
About Processing
================

   Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment built for electronic 
   arts and digital media. It is a java-based language built to teach computer programming in a visual 
   context.
   Processing can be used to build highly audio/video interactive apps, creative digital media, electronic art etc.
   In Processing, all coded programs are known as sketches.

Compiling Instructions
======================

   The Processing integrated development environment (IDE) is required to compile the sketch.
   It can be downloaded from - http://www.processing.org/
   
   Create a new folder and add all D_PAD repo contents into this folder. Simply click "Download Zip" from the 
   panel on the right. 
   https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/D_Pad
   
   Once the IDE has been downloaded, open processing, goto file -> open. Now browse to the D_PAD folder
   and open D_PAD.pde.
   Click on the "run/play" button to execute the sketch.
   
   A new window will pop up which will be the application window.
   
   NOTE : Make sure the "data" folder, the "MaximJava_api.pde" and "GUI.pde" files are present in the same
          folder where D_PAD.pde file is present. Also make sure that "Java" mode is enabled on the top right
          bar present on the Processing IDE window.
